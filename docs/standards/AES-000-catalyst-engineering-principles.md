# AES-000 Catalyst Engineering Principles

Document ID: AES-000
Title: Catalyst Engineering Principles
Status: Draft
Category: Constitutional Standard
Owner: AES
Version: 0.1.0

## Abstract

AES-000 establishes the engineering philosophy governing the Catalyst Engineering Ecosystem.

Unlike subsequent AES standards, this document does not primarily prescribe engineering procedures. It defines the principles that guide engineering judgment, standards development, automation, and repository governance throughout the Catalyst ecosystem.

All subsequent AES standards should be interpreted consistently with these principles.

## Purpose

The purpose of AES-000 is to establish the enduring engineering philosophy upon which the Catalyst Engineering Ecosystem is built.

These principles exist to guide engineering decisions, provide a common engineering vocabulary, promote long-term maintainability, improve consistency, encourage evidence-based engineering, and support automation without eliminating engineering judgment.

## Scope

These principles apply to Catalyst repositories, including CAT, AES, CAT-SCHEMA, AEMS, repo_template, P0, project repositories, documentation, automation, software, hardware, and FPGA designs.

## Philosophy

Catalyst treats engineering as a systems discipline.

Rather than optimizing individual repositories in isolation, Catalyst seeks to improve the engineering system that produces those repositories.

Engineering decisions should reduce future complexity while increasing future capability.

## Decision Framework

When multiple engineering choices satisfy functional requirements, decisions should be evaluated using the following priority:

1. Safety
2. Correctness
3. Evidence
4. Simplicity
5. Maintainability
6. Traceability
7. Automation
8. Performance
9. Convenience

Higher priorities take precedence unless an approved Architectural Decision Record explicitly justifies an exception.

## Engineering Principles

### Understanding

#### Observe Before Changing

Observe the existing system before modifying it.

#### Understand Before Improving

Optimization without understanding creates technical debt.

### Engineering Practice

#### Improve Incrementally

Prefer many small, reviewable improvements over infrequent large rewrites.

#### One Logical Change Per Commit

Each commit should represent one coherent engineering change.

#### Standards Before Automation

Automation implements standards. Automation does not define standards.

#### Automation Before Repetition

Repeated engineering activities should be evaluated for automation.

### Information Integrity

#### Git Is the Source of Truth

Repository history constitutes the authoritative engineering record.

#### Preserve Provenance

Engineering history, rationale, authorship, and references should be preserved.

#### Single Source of Authority

Every reusable engineering concept should have one authoritative owner.

#### Traceability

Engineering artifacts should be connected through documented relationships.

#### Reproducibility

Engineering work should be reproducible from repository contents.

### Engineering Judgment

#### Evidence Over Opinion

Engineering decisions should be supported by objective evidence whenever practical.

#### Simplicity

Prefer the simplest solution satisfying engineering requirements.

#### Stewardship

Repositories are long-term engineering assets. Engineers act as stewards rather than temporary owners.

#### Continuous Improvement

Catalyst should improve through measured engineering experience.

### Systems Engineering

#### Optimize the Engineering System

Improve the engineering system before optimizing individual repositories.
